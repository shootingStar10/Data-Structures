Double ended queue is a generalized queue data structure which allows insertion & deletion from both ends.

Operations:

1.) insertFront()
2.) insertLast()
3.) deleteFront()
4.) deleteLast()

5.) getFront()
6.) getRear()
7.) isFull()
8.) isEmpty()

Time Complexity: O(1) for each operation

Applications of deque

Since Deque supports both stack and queue operations, it can be used as both.
The Deque data structure supports clockwise and anticlockwise rotations in O(1) time which can be useful in certain applications.
Also, the problems where elements need to be removed and or added both ends can be efficiently solved using Deque.
For example see Maximum of all subarrays of size k problem., 0-1 BFS and Find the first circular tour that visits all petrol pumps.
