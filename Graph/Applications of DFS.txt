1.) Topological sorting

2.) Check if a graph is bipertite or not

3.) Path finding between two vertices

4.) For an unweighted graph, DFS traversal of the graph produces the minimum spanning tree and all pair shortest path tree.

5.) Detecting cycle in a graph

6.) Solving the puzzles which has only one solution

7.) Finding strongly connected componets in the graph
