1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l-1.

2) Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is 2^h – 1.

3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or minimum number of levels is  ? Log2(N+1) ? 

4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least   ? Log2L ? + 1   levels

5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

   L = T + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      T = Number of internal nodes with two children


---------------------------------------- Hand Shaking Lemma Properties in Binary Tree ---------------------------------------------


1) In a k-ary tree where every node has either 0 or k children, following property is always true.

  L = (k - 1)*I + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      I = Number of internal nodes  


2) In Binary tree, number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

   L = T + 1
Where L = Number of leaf nodes
      T = Number of internal nodes with two children
